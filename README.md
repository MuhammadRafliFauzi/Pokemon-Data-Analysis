# Pokemon-Data-Analysis
This project is a simple data analysis project using the pokemon dataset. In this project I analyzed to find out which pokemon has the highest value, which pokemon has the lowest value and how many of each type are in the pokemon dataset.

I've also included a portfolio and dataset of the project so you can get a more detailed look at the results and analysis I've done.
